\subsection{CPU State}
For the emulation the most important data structure is the CPU state. The state consists of the program, the registers,
the memory and the program counter among others. During each CPU state the next state is determined based on the 
current state and the current instruction.
The emulator terminates once the program counter is equal to the length of the program,
the emulator then returns a result containing the program counter, the current content
of the registers and the content of the memory.

The program, the registers and the memory are all defined using  compile time lists.
For the program the list is a type list as the instructions are represented by different
types. The registers are a value list, the value type can be configured (see the
\texttt{config.hpp} header), and is \lstinline{int} by default. The registers are not
accessed directly using indizes, but via an enum class which provides
more readable names for the registers. The memory is a value list with the same type
as the registers to avoid problems related to conversions. The size of the memory
can be configured, depending on the requirements but the limitations of the compiler 
(see Section \ref{sec:limitations}), need to be respected.

For the execution of the instructions a second struct called \lstinline{ExecuteInstr} is defined. 
This struct fetches the instruction based on the program counter and the program. Then
the instruction is executed and the program counter, the registers and the memory is
updated based on the result of the execution.

For the execution there is a third struct called \lstinline{InstrImpl} which is
specialized for all instructions, depending on the instruction the program counter,
registers and memory is then manipulated in each template specizalization.

The logic used for the execution of instructions is show in Listing \ref{lst:cpu}.
The struct \lstinline{CpuState} handles the transistion between states. The struct
\lstinline{ExecuteInstr} fetches the instructions and executes them.
